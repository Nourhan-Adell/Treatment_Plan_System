# Treatment Plan Management System:
It's initialcClinic software can help doctors make diagnoses. With the help of the ICD (International Classification of Diseases), doctors can make better diagnoses. Itâ€™s possible to enter all the symptoms and select the most suitable diagnosis and the corresponding treatment. Thanks to the internal knowledge database of treatment outcomes doctors can now treat patients more effectively.

In this project, I've created a RESTful API.
